# post-facto-calibration

**Quickly Getting Started:**<br />

Clone this repo with:

`git clone https://github.com/Archan6el/post-facto-calibration`
<br /><br />
Each folder will have its own readme with information about its contents

Simply run any of the 4 files using python3 and 3 graphs will automatically be generated. The first graph is the mask, the second graph is the counts (cast shadow), and the third is the cross correlation graph between the mask and shadow. 

For example with a codedaperture file: <br />
`python3 codedaperture-[VERSION].py` 
<br /><br />

There are python libraries needed to run the code. If not already installed, install them on Linux with

`pip3 install matplotlib`<br />
`pip3 install numpy` <br />
`pip3 install random`<br />
